	<div class="intro">
	
	<p>About a quarter mile down a narrow dirt path in the Town Forest of Ashland lives an old blind woman. 
	Her address long predates the paved cul-de-sac of the neighborhood now bordering the treeline, 
	where most would think the road ends to curl back around. 
	But look twice, and you&rsquo;ll notice the asphalt unassumingly changes to dirt. </p>
	
	<p>The first time I delivered her mail, I drove right past the dirt path thinking it was just one of the other house&rsquo;s driveways. 
	But then pulling up to the next address had me confused over why her letters didn&rsquo;t match its mailbox.
	Doubling back to check the previous address, which wasn&rsquo;t it either, I
	finally noticed the very small sign pointing her way into the woods.</p>
	
	<p><i>Guess I&rsquo;m going off-roading today</i></p>
	
	</div>
	
	<img class="full" src="../../../images/vehicles/postal/forest2.jpg" alt="Postal Truck in Town Forest" title="Have address, will travel">
	
	<p>It does not matter how rural, remote, or off the beaten path Americans may live, 
	the basic and fundamental public service of the US Mail will always provide a way for
	them to remain connected to the rest of the country.</p>
	
	
	<p>This public service is so fundamental that the founding fathers thought it important to enshrine its creation into the Constitution of the United States - 
	<a class="textlink" target="_blank" title="Constitution" 
	href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-8/clause-7/">Article I, Section 8, Clause 7</a>, to be exact.</p>
	
	
	
	<p>Unfortunately, not all of our leaders today hold the Constitution with the same regard. </p>
	
	<p>Earlier this week, President-elect Donald Trump announced that he is considering plans to privatize the Postal Service, 
	which has repeatedly drawn his ire for being unprofitable in its 
	mission to provide affordable six-day delivery to every American in the country.</p>
	
	<p>Trump and other critics of the service have pointed fingers at USPS for operating under a multi-billion dollar &ldquo;loss&rdquo; each year, 
	and how privatized alternatives could save taxpayers the expense by being more &ldquo;efficient.&rdquo;</p> 
	
	<p>Firstly, let&rsquo;s just get it out of the way that USPS does not receive taxpayer funding to operate. 
	It&rsquo;s a favorite comeback among postal workers to tell off the critics by informing them that &ldquo;no, your tax dollars don&rsquo;t cover my paycheck.&rdquo;</p>
	
	<p>USPS is an independent and self-funded organization within the government that relies solely on the sale of 
	postage, products and other services to cover its expenses and loans. </p>

	<p>	For fiscal year 2024, it reported a total operating revenue of around $79.5 billion 
	as well as a total operating expense of around $89.5 billion. 
	So yes, USPS did indeed run a deficit of close to $10 billion this year. But that expense will be paid through loans borrowed from the US Treasury 
	rather than tax revenue.</p>
	
	<p>This isn&rsquo;t to brush the Postal Service&rsquo;s deficit aside, $10 billion is still a large amount. 
	But now let&rsquo;s compare it to other public services, like Medicare and National Defense, which actually are taxpayer funded.
	These services cost Americans $848 billion and $820 billion respectively in 2023, according to the Office of Management and Budget. </p>
	
	<p>Yet the same language of &ldquo;losing money&rdquo; isn&rsquo;nt so often used against doctors for the elderly and disabled or 
	soldiers defending the homeland. That&rsquo;s because we all (should) understand they are essential to maintaining a functional society, 
	just like your local letter carriers.</p>
	
	<p><i>The Founding Fathers have spoken.</i></p>

	<p>While it is true that USPS can and should be improved to cut down on its deficit, 
	a topic for another post perhaps, 
	the fact of the matter is that the Postal Service is just never going to have a profitable business model.</p>
	
	<p>Nor should it. </p>
	
	<p>It&rsquo;s not profitable to deliver a Christmas card from Ashland, Massachusetts to Anchorage, Alaska for 73 cents, which is 
	the current price of a first class stamp that guarantees delivery to any address in the United States.</p>
	
	<p>Nor is it profitable to deliver medicine at a uniform rate to the elderly who live in-town or miles away on back roads of rural countryside. 
	Same zip code, same rate, same dependable service.</p>
	
	<p>The Postal Service delivers fairly to everyone because it&rsquo;s not here to make money. 
	It&rsquo;s here to provide a <i>service</i> to the people. </p>
	
	<p>Which is exactly what Trump and those surrounding him on the bandwagon of &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; refuse to acknowledge. 
	No private company is ever going to want to provide the same service to the American people that USPS does.</p>
	
	<p>Try sending a birthday card via any for-profit delivery company, it&rsquo;s gonna set you back dollars rather than cents. 
	And without the Postal Service setting the bar for affordability, 
	other companies are liable to jack up prices even further 
	as they no longer have a public option to compete with.</p>
	
	<p>Imagine the privatized healthcare industry but for your mail.</p>
	
	<p>And just like how health insurance companies often deny coverage to those who need it the most, 
	private shippers are also much less incentivised to deliver to isolated families who cost them more to reach. They will
	either charge an exorbitant price to do it themselves or pass it on to the Postal Service for last-mile delivery at a more
	fair rate. </p>
	
	<p>Under a privatized postal system, rural door-to-door delivery may very well cease to exist as
	it&rsquo;s simply not profitable to reach those addresses. Paychecks, prescription medications, and other vital mail will all be 
	held in some centralized location for pick up instead.</p>
	
	<p>Beyond the inconvenience, this is an especially worrisome thought for elderly and disabled 
	Americans who would then be forced to travel potentially miles away to get their mail. 
	That or pay an exorbitant surcharge for the same direct service they once relied on for free or significantly less.</p>
	
	<p>Such diminished service is already the goal of Trump appointed Postmaster General Louis DeJoy. His plan towards 
	&ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; includes a scheme to consolidate local post offices into centralized mega-facilities. </p>
	
	<p>That is despite the fact that a mega-facility covering an entire region is in no way more efficient to the people vs 
	our current local post offices we already have right in our own towns. 
	Missed a package that needs a signature or want to pick up your held mail after vacation? 
	Guess you&rsquo;ll have to drive half-an-hour into the city to get that now.
	
	<p>Same goes for the letter carrier who now has to make the same long drive back just to start delivering, needlessly delaying the mail.
	And that&rsquo;s not even to mention the thousands of American jobs that will be lost as smaller post offices and 
	mail processing plants are shut down to be consolidated. 
	These plans would shamefully take away the livelihoods of dedicated postal workers who keep this nation connected.
</p>
	
	<p>So this &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; is not for you, the customer, or me, the employee. 
	It&rsquo;s for those at the top who want to cut essential services at our expense and line their own pockets with the savings. </p>
	
	<p>But the people see through their scheme. Affected Americans overwhelmingly opposed DeJoy&rsquo;s consolidation efforts, 
	leading to a bipartisan coalition of senators urging him to stop. This succeeded in delaying the plan until 2025, 
	when Americans will be back to oppose it further because nobody wants such blatent <i>inefficiency.</i></p>
	
	<p>Any more ideas the incoming president or his buddy Elon Musk over at the 
	&ldquo;Department of Government Efficiency&rdquo; comes up with will most certainly face a similar backlash as 
	Americans realize how much their schemes will hurt us all.</p>
	
	<p>Privatizing the Postal Service is a terrible idea that will only make it more difficult and expensive for the people to receive vital mail, packages, and other goods 
	while staying connected with the rest of the country.</p>
