<p>When we left for Spring Break 2020, none of us in the senior class at FSU had any idea we were leaving for the very last time.</p>

<p>But over break, administrators were forced to shut our campus down and move all classes online amid growing concern for COVID-19. </p>

<p>Student organizations like The Gatepost were also forced to adapt. Despite losing our print edition, we decided to continue our publication online throughout the pandemic.</p> 

<p>I believe our efforts represent an important part of Framingham State&rsquo;s history, keeping records of the University&rsquo;s responce to the virus and student reactions.</p>

<p>Below are all of the news articles I wrote during that time.</p>

<p>The first of May in any other year would see students gather together on campus to feel the hints of summer in the air and enjoy their last few weeks with friends before the semester&rsquo;s end.</p>

<p>This May, students are separated from campus and stuck at home amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>But while they may no longer be able to meet in person for clubs and events, the Office of Student Involvement and Leadership Development (SILD) is working to keep Framingham State students connected and engaged virtually.</p>

<p>Continuing to work directly with student organizations, Director of SILD Sara Gallegos said the office has been in regular communication with them each week.</p>

<p>&ldquo;SILD staff worked with each group to help them put on virtual programming,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Each group has made their own decisions on how they want to continue in the virtual world of events.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many of these virtual events and engagement opportunities can be found on Ramlink for interested students to join. Gallegos highlighted several.</p>

<p>Every Saturday, the Student Union Activities Board (SUAB) is hosting BINGO, trivia, and virtual caricature artist events on Zoom for students&rsquo; entertainment.</p>

<p>And every day, The Hilltop Players are holding virtual video contests and posting themed pictures through Instagram.</p>

<p>WDJM 91.3 FM might be off the radio waves, but its DJs have kept the turntables spinning through the station&rsquo;s Spotify channel. Students can participate in playlist contests to vote on which songs air next.</p>

<p>Every other Tuesday, the Student Government Association still comes together for its Senate meetings through Zoom to discuss and resolve student issues. Its Spring elections closed April 17.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have been engaging with all elected students to get them transitioned into their roles,&rdquo; said Gallegos.</p>

<p>The Gaming Club hosted a &ldquo;Jackbox Party&rdquo; over Discord, and the Math Club plans to host a &ldquo;Math Magic&rdquo; event with the Museum of Math.</p>

<p>Conversations about the pandemic and its effects on life have been held by Motivation Intersectionality Solidarity Sisterhood (M.I.S.S.) as well as the Students of Caribbean Ancestry Club.</p>

<p>And The Gatepost, while unable to bring its articles to print, continues to meet every Thursday night on Zoom to copy edit and publish issues online for students and faculty alike to read on Fridays.</p>

<p>SILD itself has organized and hosted events as well, Gallegos said. These include free online programs offered by its event sponsors, promotions of online museum tours, as well as other arts and entertainment opportunities.</p>

<p>Some academic departments are also holding get-togethers online for students to join. Every Wednesday, the English department hosts a virtual &ldquo;Coffeehouse&rdquo; for students interested in reading poetry and conversing with fellow classmates and faculty.</p>

<p>Online officer transition workshops are being held on Zoom by SILD for newly registered officers of student organizations to attend, Gallegos said. &ldquo;We have offered three different times for the one workshop so we can give as much opportunity for everyone to attend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;SILD&rsquo;s number one priority is supporting students in whatever their needs are to succeed,&rdquo; said Gallegos. &ldquo;So if that means talking full-out planning strategy for fall events, or just having a conversation checking in on the student, that is what our staff is doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adapting SILD&rsquo;s work to the new virtual setting was made easier with Ramlink, the University&rsquo;s engagement platform, already hosted online prior to the pandemic, Gallegos said.</p>

<p>One challenge has been finding ways for student office assistants as well as the Student Coordinator of Events to maintain work hours online, she added. &ldquo;Unfortunately, we can&rsquo;t give them the same hours like before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The office has been working creatively to find projects for these student employees to work on, she said.&ldquo;They have all been great in helping SILD out during this time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We in SILD would like to thank all the student organizations for this entire academic year,&rdquo; Gallegos said. &ldquo;These groups have provided such great community opportunities for everyone pre- and post-pandemic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gallegos said she is further working with seniors as their class adviser and explained there is a University group dedicated to recognizing the Class of 2020.</p>

<p>All seniors are invited to attend a Virtual Toast to the Class of 2020 with President F. Javier Cevallos May 15. Those who pre-registered will receive a customized toasting flute.</p>

<p>Many departments are further planning to host virtual honors and awards ceremonies for students, Cevallos said in an email.</p>

<p>And while postponed for the time being, &ldquo;the University still has every intention of holding an in-person commencement ceremony for the Class of 2020 at some point in the future,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>Gallegos said, &ldquo;We look forward to working with everyone in the new academic year and we wish all seniors good luck!&rdquo;</p>

		<h2 style="margin-top:15px;"> FSU Career Services: Job opportunities are still available

<p>Finding a job may be difficult during the pandemic, but the Career Services and Employer Relations office at Framingham State is working to prove that opportunities are still available.</p>

<p>With over 30 virtual Zoom presentations, events, and drop-in career counseling sessions on schedule, students can discover new opportunities every week, said Dawn Ross, director of Career Services.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are sympathetic to their career anxiety and will do everything possible to ease their stress by providing online resources and our career knowledge to ease their concerns,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>For the week of April 27, seven Zoom sessions will be available and open for all students to attend. Links to join each can be found within the events page of Career Services&rsquo; website.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Paul Joseph, CEO of Contexed, will be discussing how to network effectively during the COVID-19 pandemic in a Zoom meeting co-sponsored by SGA.</p>

<p>Joseph, who is also the former president of the MetroWest Chamber of Commerce, will be online to conduct the seminar at 5 p.m.</p>

<p>Other topics of discussion for the week include exploring careers and majors while studying remotely, building an impressive LinkedIn profile, and writing cover letters in a virtual environment.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Rosemarie Teti of the Wayland School Community Programs will be presenting at a virtual employer showcase at 4:15 p.m.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I realize that our students&rsquo; priorities are elsewhere right now, but seniors should be aware that we are here to assist them in reaching their career goals,&rdquo; Ross said. &ldquo;We have virtual resources and knowledge that they will need to navigate this new hiring environment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Links to an array of resources intended to help students attain their career goals throughout the COVID-19 pandemic can be found on the main page of FSU Career Services&rsquo; website.</p>

<p>Through a collaboration effort with MassBay, FSU students can further access resources and virtual presentations offered by the community college system, said Ross.</p>

<p>Career Services at FSU will continue to offer individual student appointments, Ross added. Students can reserve time for a phone or video chat session between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.</p>

<p>Job opportunities are still available during these challenging times, Ross stressed. The Office of Career Services at FSU is here to help students reach them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are ready, willing, and able to assist our students virtually through this pandemic,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>By Leighah Beausoleil, Asst. News Editor</p>

<p>FSU administrators provided COVID-19 updates and their plans going forward, while also answering questions from the public during an open Town Hall meeting held on Zoom April 13.</p>

<p>Over 250 members of the community attended the forum.</p>

<p><b>Contingency planning for the Fall 2020 Semester</b></p>

<p>President F. Javier Cevallos addressed concerns about how and when the Fall 2020 semester will begin. Due to the unpredictable nature of COVID-19, he said there was no perfect answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have been talking about the fall with our sister institutions,&rdquo; Cevallos said. &ldquo;And one of the things that we have agreed to is that we&rsquo;re going to have the same consistent decision.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ideally, all nine sister institutions will be able to invite students back to campus in September, Cevallos added. But contingency plans are under development in case the virus delays openings further.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear to me, at least from what I can see now, that our summer courses are going to be online,&rdquo; Cevallos said.</p>

<p>Some contingency plans under consideration would impact collective bargaining agreements with the faculty union, according to Cevallos. Delaying the University&rsquo;s opening or extending semesters would affect contracts that have already been negotiated.</p>

<p>A decision for Fall 2020 has not yet been made, Cevallos said, but one will likely be announced by the end of June.</p>

<p>Ellen Zimmerman, interim provost and vice president for academic affairs, said the University has an academic continuity plan in case classes in the fall must resume online.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something we&rsquo;ll continue to do to prepare for the fall is to work with IT and the Education Technology Office,&rdquo; Zimmerman added. This will ensure faculty are prepared to host online classes and will have the technical support they need in case campus must remain closed.</p>

<p>Workshops intended to help faculty prepare for the spring semester&rsquo;s move to all online courses have been recorded and are available to re-watch on the Blackboard 101 course for faculty.</p>

<p>New online course workshop sessions will begin the week of April 27, Zimmerman said.</p>

<p><b>Administrators&rsquo; response to COVID-19</b></p>

<p>Dean of Students Meg Nowak Borrego discussed administrators&rsquo; efforts to respond to COVID-19 and overcome challenges created by it.</p>

<p>She highlighted the COVID-19 Emergency Working Group, a sub-committee of the University Emergency Planning Committee, that has met daily since March 1 to discuss and recommend solutions to the virus&rsquo; impact on the University. Members represent a wide range of offices and departments around campus.</p>

<p>Their recommendations are enacted by executive staff and included the extension of spring break for a week and the decision to move all classes online, Nowak Borrego said.</p>

<p>The committee also assisted in helping more than 1,200 students move out of their residence halls while still maintaining social distance, she added.</p>

<p>Recently, the group decided that May and June new student orientations, advising, and registration sessions will be offered remotely, Nowak Borrego said.</p>

<p>Currently, the group is working to manage the University&rsquo;s day-to-day operations, respond to government advisories, and develop contingency plans for the future, she added.</p>

<p>Nowak Borrego, who leads the group, said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m beyond grateful for the collaboration and amazing efforts that this group has undertaken in planning for and responding to this public health emergency.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In terms of facilities maintenance, Executive Vice President Dale Hamel said maintainers are cleaning the campus with disinfectants every day while paying close attention to high contact surfaces and restrooms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is especially true for the areas where we still have individuals on campus or periodically on campus,&rdquo; Hamel said.</p>

<p>After an FSU employee reported testing positive for COVID-19 April 3, Hamel said a health professional from the University contacted the Framingham Board of Health.</p>

<p>The employee identified all of those they were in contact with, he added. The building the employee had been in was disinfected multiple times.</p>

<p>With classes moving online, Connie Cabello, vice president for diversity, inclusion and community engagement (DICE), emphasized that students and faculty continue to practice inclusion and equity in virtual environments.</p>

<p>DICE and the Center for Inclusive Excellence are also continuing to look for ways to engage students, faculty, and staff, she added. &ldquo;Virtual processing spaces&rdquo; have been created for them to gather in remotely.</p>

<p>Cabello further highlighted the University&rsquo;s recent donation of $10,000 in medical supplies to local hospitals and conversations about how it can support food security in the greater community.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While we&rsquo;re thinking about our internal stakeholders, we&rsquo;re also thinking about how we can be good neighbors and community members at this time,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Ilene Hofrenning, director of the Health Center, highlighted that the Health and Wellness Center as well as the Counseling Center are still open to all students remotely through &ldquo;telehealth&rdquo; and &ldquo;tele-therapy&rdquo; sessions by phone.</p>

<p><b>Financial impact on the University</b></p>

<p>Hamel addressed concerns about the University&rsquo;s Fiscal Year 2021 (FY21) budget.</p>

<p>The University has had &ldquo;sound financial footing,&rdquo; Hamel said, but it now faces both immediate and long-term repercussions due to COVID-19, which affect both FY20 and FY21.</p>

<p>In the short term, &ldquo;The net impact on FSU, after taking into account savings that we&rsquo;ve identified, is approximately $4 million,&rdquo; Hamel explained.</p>

<p>Of that total, reimbursements to students for housing, dining, and parking represent $3 million after identifying and negotiating savings with various vendors, Hamel added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This liability will result in a reduction in fund balances,&rdquo; he said. These include residence halls and dining trust funds.</p>

<p>The last million is largely associated with IT costs, Hamel said. The cost of &ldquo;laptop expenses, licensing media for creation of virtual events, training costs, additional planning, and a host of other various costs&rdquo; are included.</p>

<p>The net impact is &ldquo;around 3.1% of the annual operating budget,&rdquo; Hamel added. &ldquo;So, while it&rsquo;s a large dollar amount, in terms of the aggregate impact on that, it&rsquo;s insignificant, and certainly one that we have addressed in the past.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He added, &ldquo;In the short term, that will be covered through college operations keeping us on balance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Regarding a recent federal funding stimulus bill that includes funding for higher education, &ldquo;Our allocation of that is about $3.9 million,&rdquo; Hamel said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll likely only be able to use &ndash; because of the restrictions on it &ndash; 50% to cover the institutional impact,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;That is the $4 million previously identified, and we&rsquo;ll need to designate 50% to student financial aid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In terms of the economic cycle created by COVID-19, &ldquo;This one could be a little different than what we&rsquo;ve experienced in the past, largely because of the unknown,&rdquo; Hamel said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At this point, we don&rsquo;t know the impact on enrollment in the fall,&rdquo; he explained. The current circumstances may impact students&rsquo; decisions of whether or not to start college or to continue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know the impact on state appropriations,&rdquo; Hamel added.</p>

<p>The original FY21 budget presented to the Board of Trustees in March will need to be altered given the current situation, Hamel said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had assumed state funding at 3%,&rdquo; he added. A 3.5% reduction in enrollment was also assumed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We need to prepare for, probably at best, level state funding, and I know people are concerned about what that might mean,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything more than others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We should recognize there will be very tight funds available to the state,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of different variables with different impacts, and all of that really will have an impact on what the fall enrollment will be,&rdquo; Hamel said. There is still planning to be done for all the potential outcomes due to the number of variables involved.</p>

<p>Lorretta Holloway, vice president for enrollment and student development, addressed a question pertaining to students who are experiencing financial crises.</p>

<p>Holloway said the University has always had a Students in Crisis Emergency Funding Policy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a form on the website that if a student has a financial crisis, they can fill it out,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We have various kinds of funding depending on the student&rsquo;s situation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is also a &ldquo;student support fund&rdquo; that is financed through donations, which Holloway said she administers.</p>

<p><b>Technology concerns after the move to online classes</b></p>

<p>Most challenges faced by students in a virtual college environment revolve around technology, said Zimmerman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our students are working in very challenging circumstances &#8230; where they have either inadequate or absent internet service in their homes,&rdquo; she explained.</p>

<p>Another challenge is dealing with distractions in crowded homes during the stay-at-home advisory, she added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t help them with their family situations, but what we can do is be super flexible in what we require of them,&rdquo; Zimmerman said.</p>

<p>She highlighted efforts by the Academic Policies Committee and the All University Committee that allowed a new Pass/Fail Policy to be instituted. Deadlines for incomplete work as well as class withdrawals have also been extended.</p>

<p>Holloway discussed efforts to expand her existing laptop loaner program to help students without access to computers at home. It has received newly refurbished laptops from the IT department.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not everyone has equal access to technology,&rdquo; she said. The program has loaned out all but one of its laptops, with one being shipped out to a student as of the meeting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We also have students who are concerned about their internet access,&rdquo; Holloway added. &ldquo;They might not have been concerned before, but might be more concerned now just because there are so many people at home working remotely and using the internet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Holloway said she is working with IT to order &ldquo;MiFis,&rdquo; wireless devices that allow users access to the internet on the go, to provide to students who lack internet access at home.</p>

<p>But given the circumstances, technological devices are taking time to deliver, she added. &ldquo;We are hoping that those will be coming soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>New college to form at the University</b></p>

<p>As part of the proposed Academic Affairs restructuring plan, the University will form a new college, said Zimmerman.</p>

<p>Education as well as social and behavioral sciences currently represent two separate colleges, but the restructuring plan combines them into one, Zimmerman explained. The three other colleges of Arts &amp; Humanities, Business, and Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Math remain unchanged.</p>

<p>This brings the University to four colleges in total.</p>

<p><b>Fundraising, alumni matters, and events for seniors</b></p>

<p>Eric Gustafson, vice president of development and alumni relations, said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve refocused our fundraising almost entirely on emergency financial support for students.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alumni and friends of the University are concerned about students in economic crisis during this time, he said. They&rsquo;ve replenished funds supporting students who have lost jobs or other means of affording school.</p>

<p>As fundraising events can no longer be held in person due to nationwide restrictions on large gatherings, Gustafson said engagement efforts have taken place online. These include expanded social media efforts, webinars, and programs such as a new online book club.</p>

<p>During this time, individual contact with alumni has also remained a focus for his department. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re attempting to personally call every alumna who&rsquo;s already celebrated their 50th reunion,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re really our most vulnerable alumni in terms of age,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;What we really want to do is check in on them, and make sure they&rsquo;re doing all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His department seeks to connect these alumni with resources that may help them through the pandemic and &ldquo;if nothing else, just provide friendly conversations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another focus has been on bringing senior events online, Gustafson said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is, we all know, a very unfortunate situation for the Class of 2020,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;All of the rites of passage that come with graduating from college are gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His office hopes to provide some of the events seniors would have been invited to attend on campus, such as the Senior Toast Tradition, virtually as they are welcomed to the Alumni Association.</p>

<p>Additionally, displays and collections at the currently closed Danforth Art Museum have been posted for viewing online, Gustafson said. They can be found on the Danforth&rsquo;s social media accounts and website.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One interesting note is today is actually the one-year anniversary of the reopening of the Danforth as part of Framingham State University,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the way we planned to celebrate it, but there is a special video that just went online today celebrating that one-year anniversary,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>Holloway said, &ldquo;There is a bright side to what we&rsquo;re doing, even though right now, it seems that we&rsquo;re in a very dark place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the work and the collaborations between Academic Affairs, and PTO, and IT, and Student Affairs &ndash; it really makes me hopeful,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everyone can act well when things are good,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;It really shows character when you act well when things are not good. And I have to say, I&rsquo;m really proud of the way everyone has been acting and I thank you for helping us do our jobs.&rdquo;</p>

<br>

<p>For all the front-line workers keeping the nation afloat throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, there are others, just as crucial, who are working to ensure they have the supplies they need.</p>

<p>One critical supply everyone needs is face masks &ndash; worn not only to reduce the chance of catching the virus, but to help prevent it from spreading to others as well.</p>

<p>But as more and more masks are being used after the CDC and Gov. Charlie Baker recommended anyone going outside wear one, manufacturers have not been able to keep up with demand &ndash; even for front-line workers.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a dilemma recognized by members of the Fashion Design &amp; Retailing Department at Framingham State University, who are now sewing face masks by the hundreds to donate to local hospitals and nursing homes in need.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My initial concern was the effectiveness against the virus,&rdquo; Professor Virginia Noon said about the masks she&rsquo;s making. &ldquo;But I quickly learned that anything is better than what they had, which was nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With 40 masks made and another 40 underway, Noon said she was inspired to sew by close friends and family members who work in the medical field.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Care givers, doctors, and nurses did not have protection,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I responded to the immediate need to protect the health-care workers from the virus and also to protect the non-COVID-19 patients from the virus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Noon said she currently sews a basic rectangular mask with three tucks and elastic following the guidelines from a hospital in Oregon. She will adapt her pattern to have an opening for filters once she receives a supply of meltbrown cloth &ndash; a non-woven fabric used in traditional surgical masks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The filter can be discarded and the cotton fabric mask can be washed after wearing,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<img class="half" src="../../../images/folder_gatepost/img_covid_gp/fsu_masks-1.png">
<img class="half" style="float:right" src="../../../images/folder_gatepost/img_covid_gp/fsu_masks-2.png">
<p class="right">Face masks sewn by Professor Virginia Noon, Fashion Design and Retailing Department</p>

<p>Lab Technician Christine Jansen said she is using two patterns to sew her 100% quilters cotton masks.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;serger pattern&rdquo; is quick and easy, and offers space for a center filter, Jansen said. Another pattern for pleated masks can be made using a regular sewing machine. In total, she has made &ldquo;well over 100 masks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many of these masks have gone to her daughter, who Jansen said is an essential worker. She brings them in for her co-workers to wear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I heard there was a desperate need for sewers to make masks, I started right away,&rdquo; Jansen added. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m extremely happy to help people by being able to use my skills.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s not just the faculty from Fashion Design &amp; Retailing who are hard at work making these masks, said Department Chair Pamela Sebor-Cable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are so many people doing this,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;We have students, alums, staff, and faculty all working individually on these and donating them to a variety of elder-care homes, hospitals, and other people in need in their area.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The landlord of one of her students is also a quiltist and they have begun sewing masks together, Sebor-Cable added. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to know that in a time of distancing, this is a way people can share a positive experience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everyone I know with a sewing machine is sewing masks,&rdquo; said Noon. &ldquo;People want to help. Those who cannot use a sewing machine are cutting fabric squares and elastic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of Noon&rsquo;s friends has been cutting squares for her, which saves time and allows her to focus on stitching the masks together, she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I delivered 12 to my doctor&rsquo;s office and 20 to my brother, who will distribute to friends and neighbors,&rdquo; Noon added. She said she has a long list of orders to fill.</p>

<p>Noon&rsquo;s son, a grocery store employee for Market Basket, has also repeatedly received masks from customers, she said. &ldquo;People making masks are just dropping them off for employees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, with everyone now making masks, materials like elastic bands are becoming harder to come by, said Sebor-Cable, who has sewn 125 masks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fortunately, one of the donations we received in the department a few years back was a couple of 144 yard spools of three-eighths inch elastic,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have been using that and sending it to others to use.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Noon said she has ordered 750 yards of elastic and about 60 yards of meltbrown cloth. &ldquo;My goal is to distribute these essential supplies to others making masks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Speaking of her own masks, &ldquo;As you are stitching, it is just a good feeling,&rdquo; Noon said. &ldquo;Knowing that your efforts may be helping someone remain safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An employee of Framingham State reported testing positive for COVID-19 April 3.</p>

<p>Students and faculty of the University were notified of the report through a campus-wide email sent by President F. Javier Cevallos that same day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This employee has not been on campus for more than a week,&rdquo; Cevallos said in the email.</p>

<p>The University has consulted the Framingham Department of Health and plans to comply with all recommendations it provides regarding the individual, anyone who was in contact with the individual, as well as the physical work area(s) of the individual, Cevallos added.</p>

<p>Most students and faculty have not been on campus since spring break began March 13.</p>

<p>The University announced its decision to cancel all on-campus courses in favor of remote instruction March 16.</p>

<p>Students were asked to move all belongings out of their residence halls and commuter lockers before March 29. The residence hall move-out was conducted in phases to limit how many students moved out at a single time.</p>

<p>As per the University&rsquo;s Public Health Emergency Plan, all students, faculty, and staff will be notified about any incidents relating to coronavirus on campus.</p>

<p>Students who feel the need to speak with someone after this incident may contact the Counseling Office, Cevallos said in the email. Concerned employees may contact the Employee Assistance Program.</p>

<p>Employees are encouraged to continue to self-monitor for symptoms of COVID-19, Cevallos&rsquo; email stated. These include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, according to the CDC.</p>

<p>The University requests that employees who do experience these symptoms, or have been in close contact with someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19, stay home and contact the Office of Human Resources.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The health and safety of our community continues to be the highest priority of the University, particularly during this challenging time,&rdquo; Cevallos added.</p>

	<h2 style="margin-top:15px;"> Pass/Fail option approved for all classes
		<br><span style="font-weight:normal"><nobr>April 3, 2020</nobr></span></h2>

<p>Students at Framingham State can now request pass/fail grades for any or all of their courses taken during the Spring 2020 semester.</p>

<p>The University&rsquo;s current policy, which limits students to one pass/fail grade per semester, has been suspended for the remainder of the academic year.</p>

<p>Responding to concerns from students and faculty over classes moving online due to COVID-19, the All University Committee (AUC) voted unanimously in favor of granting the option in a fast-tracked virtual meeting held Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it will clearly help a lot of our students &ndash; and faculty for that matter &ndash; deal with the stresses of moving everything online,&rdquo; said Ellen Zimmerman, interim provost and vice president of academic affairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All of our sister institutions have passed, or are in the process of passing, similar policies,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;d be very remiss not to offer this protection to our students.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For Spring 2020, the committee decided that a pass grade, which grants course credit, is equivalent to a D- or higher for all courses. This grade is not calculated into GPA.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As long as you receive a grade of D- or higher, selecting a pass/fail grade will not affect your current GPA,&rdquo; Zimmerman said in an email announcing the change, sent Wednesday evening.</p>

<p>A failing grade, below D-, does not grant course credit and still counts as zero points toward a student&rsquo;s GPA.</p>

<p>The new temporary Pass/Fail Policy has been in the making since spring break, when Zimmerman and the University&rsquo;s academic deans submitted a proposal for it to the Academic Policy Committee (APC).</p>

<p>&ldquo;APC considered several possible implications of the policy,&rdquo; said Laura Lamontagne, committee chair. These included implications to financial aid, the impact to students on academic probation, and classes that require prerequisite grades, among others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ultimately, APC suggested some minor modifications, but decided this policy will help students navigate the new online format,&rdquo; she told The Gatepost.</p>

<p>Prior to the policy change, many FSU students expressed concern over how moving to all online classes may affect their grades. A student-led Change.org petition advocating pass/fail be added for all classes was started by senior Andrew Knorr last month.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many students rely on in-person instruction and do not thrive in an online setting. Creating an opt-in option for a pass/fail grading system can increase fairness,&rdquo; the petition states.</p>

<p>The petition emphasized keeping pass/fail an option for students who prefer to remain on the letter grade scale and receive grades that will count toward their GPA.</p>

<p>It received 1,639 signatures by the time the policy change was announced Wednesday evening. However, it is unclear how many signers are actual students as the petition is public.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy the school decided to listen to the students and go with the trend other schools are regarding the pass/fail system,&rdquo; Knorr told The Gatepost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think they did a very good job implementing it in a way that will really benefit students,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it made a lot of people happy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some members of AUC did voice concerns about pass/fail being an option for students, rather than mandatory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are some medical schools that are saying they&rsquo;ll only accept pass/fail grades if students were not given a choice,&rdquo; said Margaret Carroll, dean of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. She added that some graduate schools and at least one accrediting agency agree.</p>

<p>Larry McKenna, professor of physics and earth science, said, &ldquo;the optional nature of the pass/fail option is &ndash; in my opinion &ndash; inequitable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He explained that some students may be less advantaged than others in online-only settings due to unfair differences in their ability to connect to the internet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those with better situations at home will choose to accept their &lsquo;A&rsquo;s. Those who are, for no fault of their own, required to suffer through poor internet connections, will be forced to choose P/F, contributing to the very inequity we seek to avoid,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I urge that we make the P/F mandatory for all students,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>McKenna was not able to vote on the proposed policy as he had to leave the meeting to attend his office hours.</p>

<p>Zimmerman said she is also concerned about equity issues, but added that making the Pass/Fail Policy mandatory presents its own set of inequity challenges.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are students who may be on academic probation, and they were counting on this semester to bring their grades up so that they can get off of that,&rdquo; she said. Other students may need grades to apply for graduate schools or become eligible for sports.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;re earning good grades, they don&rsquo;t want to lose that,&rdquo; Zimmerman said. &ldquo;They want those added into their GPA.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grades are also necessary to receive financial aid as well as to apply for scholarships and grants based on GPA, said Lorretta Holloway, vice president for enrollment and student development. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t keep those with a pass/fail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Matty Benett, SGA president and AUC member, said students like himself appreciate having the option to choose pass/fail or retain their letter grades for their transcripts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was already not our choice to not be on campus,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We should not, in my opinion, be forced into accepting a pass/fail system.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amanda Simons, associate professor of biology, said while she has concerns regarding the policy change, &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s time to just accept that there&rsquo;s not a perfect solution.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Students are worried and faculty are worried,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It has to get done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The committee voted unanimously to approve the new policy.</p>

<p>Students may request pass/fail grades between May 18 and May 27 via MyFramingham to the University Registrar, according to Zimmerman&rsquo;s email. They may view their original letter grade before submitting the request.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just wanted to say how impressed I am by how everybody on this committee and on APC pulled together to get something like this done,&rdquo; said Zimmerman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that you&rsquo;ve met at weird times and spent a lot of extra time on this, and I just can&rsquo;t tell you how much I appreciate it and how much I admire your dedication,&rdquo; she added.</p>

<p>Framingham State administrators have created a COVID-19 Emergency Working Group to discuss and recommend solutions to challenges the University faces due to the pandemic.</p>

<p>Meeting daily at 8:30 am, the group comprises a variety of offices around campus, said Dean of Students Meg Nowak Borrego, who also leads the group.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Due to the variety of points of view and specialties of the members in the working group many different topics are discussed, vetted, and then moved to recommendation and implementation,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>These range from basic adaptations, such as the language of signs placed on the doors of now locked campus buildings, to complex and large scale changes, such as requiring students to move out of residence halls and updating the University&rsquo;s emergency public health preparedness plan, she explained.</p>

<p>As a sub-committee of the University Emergency Planning Committee, the group began formal meetings March 1, Nowak Borrego said. Though informal discussions began earlier in February.</p>

<p>Included are sub-groups dedicated to domestic and international travel policies, academic operations and policies, campus events, virtual student engagement, and promoting excellent student, faculty and staff remote work, she said.</p>

<p>More will likely be added as the pandemic evolves, she added.</p>

<p>Regarding University operations, the group provides recommendations to Executive Staff, who make the final decision, according to Nowak Borrego. The group is also in communication with and receiving guidance from local, state, and federal agencies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am forever grateful for the amazing efforts that this group has undertaken in planning for and responding to this public health emergency,&rdquo; Nowak Borrego said. </p>

	<h2 style="margin-top:15px;"> Framingham State University postpones commencement due to COVID-19
		<br><span style="font-weight:normal"><nobr>March 27, 2020</nobr></span></h2>

<div class="accordian_content_full" style="border-top:2px solid black">

<p>Framingham State&rsquo;s 2020 Commencement ceremonies have been postponed out of precaution for COVID-19.</p>

<p><q>This is not a decision we take lightly,</q> wrote President F. Javier Cevallos in a campus-wide email sent March 18. <q>Some schools across the country are considering canceling commencement all together, but that is not a step I am willing to take.</q></p>

<p>A new date for the baccalaureate and graduate commencement ceremonies, originally scheduled for May 24 in the Worcester DCU Center Arena and Convention Center, has not yet been determined by the University&rsquo;s graduation committee, Cevallos said.</p>

<p>However, the event will likely take place at the end of summer or early fall, depending on how the coronavirus pandemic develops, he told The Gatepost.</p>

<p>Senior Jasmin Hill, who had just ordered her cap and gown before spring break, said it was upsetting for her to read Cevallos&rsquo; email. <q>I felt like maybe the decision was a bit early, since we have a lot of time between now and May.</p>

<p><q>But on the other hand, I understand his decision,</q> she added. <q>He&rsquo;s worried about everyone&rsquo;s health and safety. And when that comes into the picture, you have to make a tough decision, even if it&rsquo;s a decision that the whole community isn&rsquo;t a fan of.</q></p>

<p>With 1,838 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Massachusetts as of noon Thursday &ndash; some colleges and universities have decided to hold their commencement ceremonies virtually for students and their families to attend while at home.</p>

<p>FSU is not considering a virtual option, Cevallos said. <q>I think graduation is a truly important day in your life, and a virtual ceremony is just not the right way to celebrate.</q></p>

<p>Senior Domenique Page said she was thankful Cevallos made the decision to keep commencement offline. <q>I think it would be downright cruel to not give students an event where they could physically display their achievement and celebrate as a class.</q></p>

<p>However, <q>There will be a lot of unhappy students, including myself, if the president goes back on his word,</q> Page added.</p>

<p>Students will receive an update email once the commencement committee reaches a decision on how and when the ceremony will take place, Cevallos added.</p>

<p>Until that date is set, the schedule for when students may pick up or purchase graduation caps and gowns at the Campus Store has also been postponed, said Keith Jacques, store manager.</p>

<p>With commencement being postponed, senior Tony Perone expressed concern over how and when graduating seniors will be issued their degrees.</p>

<p>According to Ellen Zimmerman, interim provost and vice president of Academic Affairs, students who complete all of their degree requirements before May 31, the official graduation date, will have their degree posted to their academic record on that day.</p>

<p>Diplomas will be mailed to those students in June to the mailing address the University has on file for them, she added.</p>

<p>The decision to postpone this year&rsquo;s commencement came after Gov. Charlie Baker issued an order prohibiting large gatherings of over 250 people March 13. This order was expanded to ban gatherings of 25 people or more March 15.</p>

<p><q>Everyone has a role to play in stopping the spread of the coronavirus,</q> said Baker in a statement. <q>By limiting large gatherings, we can further mitigate the spread of the disease.</q></p>

<p>Currently, gatherings of 10 or more people are now prohibited by the Baker administration through an order issued March 23.</p>

<p>These gatherings include <q>community, civic, public, leisure, faith-based events, and any similar event or activity that brings together more than 10 persons in any confined indoor or outdoor space,</q> according to a press release.</p>

<p>Postponing commencement is one of several decisions FSU administrators have made in response to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Following the governor&rsquo;s guidance, FSU will be moving all on-campus courses to remote instruction beginning March 30 and through the rest of the spring semester, according to a campus-wide email sent by Cevallos March 15.</p>

<p>Resident students will not be allowed to return to their dorms after spring break unless they file a request with the University.</p>

<p>For senior Siobh&aacute;n Senier, these past few weeks have made her experience the <q>five stages of grief.</q></p>

<p><q>Of course, we have no choice but to accept the decision,</q> she said. <q>But moving on is the hardest part for seniors that have to suddenly pack up their lives and move home without saying proper goodbyes.</q></p>

<p>While Senier said she believes the decisions were for the best considering the circumstances, she still expressed disappointment at not being able to finish the rest of her college career the way she had hoped.</p>

<p><q>But on the other hand, new memories will be made,</q> she added. <q>I will keep close contacts with my friends and professors to maintain a strong bond, and I am looking forward to walking across that stage among my family and friends more than anything in the world!</q></p>

<p> [Editor's note: Both the 2020 and 2021 commencement ceremonies at Framingham State were eventually canceled and replaced with online alternatives.]</p>
