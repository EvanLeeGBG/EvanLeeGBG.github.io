<div class="accordian_content_full" style="border-top:2px solid black">

<p>I recently made the mistake of buying a cheap new bicycle off eBay.</p>

<p>When it arrived, the box&rsquo;s &ldquo;this side up&rdquo; arrow did not point up, an axle had pierced through its side, and the only protection found within was some paper to prevent scratching.</p>

<p>It was scratched anyway.</p>

<p>But undeterred by the scratches, dents, and buyer&rsquo;s remorse, I set about putting my new bike together.</p>

<p>A task which didn&rsquo;t seem like it&rsquo;d be too much of a challenge at the time &ndash; just a few nuts and bolts to tighten, right?</p>

<p>Wrong.</p>

<p>The bike, having been made outside the U.S., was manufactured to metric standards &ndash; unsurprising since most other countries use the Metric System, but problematic here as we still rely on the Imperial System.</p>

<p>And evidently, metric hex sockets don&rsquo;t get along with imperial Allen wrenches.</p>

<p>While the difference is just slightly off in their measurements, it&rsquo;s enough to keep my bicycle in pieces while I write this article. A rather pathetic tragedy, I guess, but one that when expanded over a global scale, leaves more than enough room for actual catastrophes to happen.</p>

<p>Case in point: the infamous Mars Climate Orbiter incident of 1999.</p>

<p>When NASA launched its orbiter in December &rsquo;98 to embark on a $327.6 million mission, it&rsquo;s unlikely that anyone expected a measly metric miscalculation to lead them to complete loss less than a year later.</p>

<p>But, according to Arthur Stephenson of the Mars Climate Orbiter Mission Failure Investigation Board, that&rsquo;s exactly what happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The root cause of the loss of the spacecraft was the failed translation of [imperial] units into metric units in a segment of ground-based, navigation-related mission software,&rdquo; he said in a report.</p>

<p>Essentially, two separate mission teams were working with two different systems of measurement. Which is perfectly fine, until they have to share information with one another.</p>

<p>And apparently, when those two teams did go to share their information, they failed to convert the units they originally used, the investigation board found.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a dilemma that anyone who has taken science classes may have encountered during exams.</p>

<p>If the conversion is done improperly in part A, then any attempts at doing parts B or C will be misguided since the information gathered to do so is wrong.</p>

<p>And screwing up on the test because of that is frustrating &ndash; I know from experience &ndash; but imagine how it must feel to do the same thing on a $327.6 million mission.</p>

<p>Probably not good.</p>

<p>Inevitably, the measurement error led to mission failure as the orbiter either drifted off into space or crashed somewhere it wasn&rsquo;t supposed to on Mars.</p>

<p>An expensive mistake to say the least, but one that NASA didn&rsquo;t blame on the different units involved &ndash; rather, NASA&rsquo;s leadership blamed it on themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The problem here was not the error, it was the failure of NASA&rsquo;s systems engineering, and the checks and balances in our processes to detect the error. That&rsquo;s why we lost the spacecraft,&rdquo; according to NASA&rsquo;s Associate Administrator for Space Science at the time, Edward Weiler.</p>

<p>While it&rsquo;s certainly true that NASA had failed to catch that error, is it really fair not to place any blame on the difference in measurement systems?</p>

<p>To put it bluntly, had only one system been used, then there would have never been any risk for such an error to have occurred in the first place.</p>

<p>And though NASA has improved its error detection methods since 1999, so long as the Metric and Imperial systems of measurement continue their attempt to co-exist here in the U.S., the risk of another error slipping through still remains &ndash; both for NASA and suckers who buy bikes off eBay.</p>

<p>Recently, an op/ed was published by my colleague at The Gatepost highlighting the perceived folly of using both the Metric and Imperial Systems, and the problems when using them together.</p>

<p>In the article, the writer points to his personal experiences purchasing a foreign bicycle that had metric-sized parts incompatible with Imperial, or United States Customary System (USCS), sized wrenches, and the 1999 failure of the Mars Climate Orbiter, in which a miscalculation due to the use of both units resulted in the loss of the satellite.</p>

<p>While these may be good arguments for moving toward one global system, the most important aspects of life have already transitioned to one system &ndash; the Metric one.</p>

<p>Switching every miniscule aspect of life away from one system to the other would result in a loss of the culture unique and identifiable to the United States.</p>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s look at the current reality of measurement systems used in professional areas.</p>

<p>We can see the usage of the Metric System in every STEM field and job. I wonder if there is even an official STEM textbook in the United States that doesn&rsquo;t use the Metric System for anything beyond the fundamentals.</p>

<p>Likewise, any international industry can&rsquo;t use the Imperial System without risking mistranslations that could cost millions of dollars to fix.</p>

<p>Further, the federal government itself passed the Metric Conversion Act of 1975, which stated that the Metric System was &ldquo;the preferred system of weights and measures for U.S. trade and commerce,&rdquo; called on the movement to the Metric System by companies, and even stated that the government had to help with the voluntary change.</p>

<p>So, with the government offering to help create the change, why, over 40 years later, do we still use two systems of measurement?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s ask another question &ndash; which would you rather eat, a quarter-pounder, or a 113.4-gram hamburger?</p>

<p>The USCS is a system engrained not in American eagerness to reject something foreign, but in hundreds of years of cultural and social identification through measurements both easy to express and easy to remember.</p>

<p>Cup of Joe. Footlong hotdog. Ton of bricks &ndash; easy to understand, easy to imagine, and unable to be translated into Metric.</p>

<p>These are the shorthands and standards of American culture.</p>

<p>Of my culture.</p>

<p>Every concession has been made where it needs to be in the professional world. Beyond that, the USCS has been designed for human use over hundreds of years.</p>

<p>A cup of Joe is about 8 ounces. A footlong hotdog is at least as big as my foot. A ton of bricks is too many for me to count, but I know it&rsquo;s an awful lot, and it hurts when it falls on you.</p>

<p>Is moving to one measurement system an attack on who I am? No, that&rsquo;s ridiculous. It&rsquo;s an argument that has existed for hundreds of years before the Metric System.</p>

<p>But, the ideological ham-fisting of the Metric System into everyday life, through a call for a single, universal system, is something I can&rsquo;t support.</p>

<p>For all my life, and my parents&rsquo; lives, and my grandparents&rsquo; lives, every measurement we&rsquo;ve used has been good enough for us. Our system isn&rsquo;t worried about putting people on Mars, and we know that.</p>

<p>But we also know how many cups of Joe we need in the morning. We know how full we feel after a footlong hotdog. And we will be damn sure dissatisfied if the Metric System hits us like a ton of bricks.</p>

<div class="accordian_content_full" style="border-top:2px solid black">
<p>A bicycle, a cup of Joe, and this royalty free image of &ldquo;steel_ruler_closeup&rdquo; have all come to define an epic debate of immeasurable wit &ndash; and lousy gags &ndash; between a colleague and me over &#8230; systems of measurement.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re both the life of the party.</p>

<p>It all began after I wrote an article on my experiences in trying, and failing, to build a Metric-made foreign bicycle with Imperial measured American tools.</p>

<p>A case of &ldquo;Measurement madness,&rdquo; as I called it.</p>

<p>But not allowing this tragedy to go in vain, I decided to draw upon it &ndash; along with a more important mix-up by NASA in 1999 &ndash; to argue that only chaos and confusion prevails when Metric and Imperial collide.</p>

<p>And thus, it is no longer feasible for them to coexist within the U.S.</p>

<p>Yet, my colleague has gone &ldquo;The whole 8.23 meters&rdquo; to disagree.</p>

<p>He countered in his own article that not only is it unnecessary to move to one system, it would be unwise as the consequences of doing so are culturally catastrophic.</p>

<p>He raised to my article a cup of Joe before dropping a ton of bricks over it. Those being just a few of &ldquo;the shorthands and standards of American culture&rdquo; that would be lost to the mediocrity of Metric &ndash; the global system likeliest to dethrone Imperial.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s an argument I can sympathize with.</p>

<p>Because I like the Imperial System. It&rsquo;s worked for me, it&rsquo;s worked for my colleague, and it&rsquo;s worked for generations before us &ndash; as he pointed out in his article. Not to mention it&rsquo;s what every tool I&rsquo;ve owned was once measured by.</p>

<p>But I have to emphasize once now &ndash; because I finally built my bike.</p>

<p>It cost me an extra $12 to get the metric tools I needed &ndash; on top of something I already paid too much for &ndash; but it marked my preparation for the future.</p>

<p>And the future is in Metric.</p>

<p>But why? Why bother changing to Metric when I&rsquo;ve just conceded that Imperial still works?</p>

<p>Well, why change to the automobile when horse drawn carriages still work?</p>

<p>Truly, the covered wagon is an American cultural icon. For generations, they took us across the entire continental U.S. while leaving cultural legacies along each rut of every trail they made.</p>

<p>And, as the Amish would contend, they still work just as well today.</p>

<p>Yet by the turn of the 20th century, Americans had begun to abandon the traditional ways of their wagons for a newer system &ndash; the horseless carriage.</p>

<p>And while these two systems of transportation did share the roads at first, it inevitably became apparent that such harmony couldn&rsquo;t last.</p>

<p>Imagine trying to merge a wagon onto Route 9 &ndash; it&rsquo;d just be a disaster waiting to happen.</p>

<p>A disaster not unlike the madness of Metric merging with Imperial.</p>

<p>I lost an extra $12 last week because of that mix-up, NASA lost $327.6 million in 1999, and somebody else is probably losing out right now.</p>

<p>When does the systemically driven madness end?</p>

<p>Well, for systems of transportation, it ended midway through the 20th century as the horse drawn carriage culture of America&rsquo;s past was all but overtaken by the current car culture of today.</p>

<p>The Oregon Trail, despite its countless crossings and cultural significance, was succeeded by Route 66 &ndash; now a cultural icon in of itself.</p>

<p>And perhaps this foreshadows the end to shared systems of measurement in the 21st century, as the newer Metric System increasingly shows up in our everyday lives.</p>

<p>And not just for big businesses and organizations, but for common Americans who might make the mistake of buying a bike off the internet without checking what system it&rsquo;s measured by first.</p>

<p>Just as Route 66 came to have the nickname of &ldquo;America&rsquo;s mother road,&rdquo; perhaps Metric will come to be known as America&rsquo;s measurement system.</p>
